# Music-Recommendation-System
Content based and Emotion-driven Music Recommendation System

# ***app.py is the Flask App which is to be executed for running this project***

Developed a personalized music recommendation system based on user preferences and emotions. Used Spotify API to get user playlistâ€™s data for generating recommendations. 

Implemented DeepFace for emotion detection from user photos, adding emotional context to recommendations. Trained a Neural Network Model to understand emotion associated with music based on song features. Performed Feature Engineering on Spotify data and calculated recommendation scores using Euclidean Distance. Deployed the recommendation system using Flask, showcasing backend development skills.

p.s. all the data was extracted by me.
